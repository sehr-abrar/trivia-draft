## Notes

One challenge was connecting the buttons and labels in the storyboard to the code using IBOutlet and IBAction. Another challenge was implementing the logic to track the current question and update the UI as the user moved through the quiz. I was able to overcome these obstacles by reviewing class materials, testing the app frequently, and debugging step by step.
